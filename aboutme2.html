   <h1><b> A lil bit About Me</b></h1>
 <About>
   <p> <b> My name is Nia, but my fans (the Nihive) <br> call me Niyonce. I am six feet tall, but I'm actually <br> terrible at basketball. Shocking right? I'm good at <br> other stuff though, like visual art, music <br> composition, creative writing, film, animation, and fashion design. <br> I also enjoy memes, computer coding, reading about science <br> and medicine, watching movies, hanging out with friends, the beach, dancing (although I have zero rhythm), and doing my hair. I don't dislike that many things, with the exception of mayonnaise and Lil Yachty's commercials. He seems cool but he has a weird voice and his hair looks like hot cheetos. Someone had to say it... </b></p>
